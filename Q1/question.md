You are given a string representing a sequence of N arrows, each pointing in one of the four cardinal directions: up ('^'), down ('v'), left ('<') or right ('>').

Write a function solution that, given a string S denoting the directions of the arrows, returns the minimum number of arrows that must be rotated to make them all point in the same direction.

Examples:

1. Given S = "^vv<v", the function should return 2. After rotating both the first ('^') and fourth ('<') arrows downwards ('v'), all of the arrows would point down.

2. Given S = "v>>>vv", the function should return 3. After rotating the first, fifth and sixth arrow rightwards, all of the arrows would point right.

3. Given S = "<<<" the function should return 0. All of the arrows already point left.

Assume that:

N is an integer within the range [1..100];
string S is made only of the following characters: '^', 'v', '<' and/or '>'.
In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
